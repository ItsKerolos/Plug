Performance Issues and Bugs:
  
Testing:
  ☐ invalid image url
  ☐ invalid image path 

  ☐ setup a Jest environment for unit testing
    - we need to test
      (enable & disable & load & unload & killing)
      those things can break the shell if an issue during them,
      (it won't be that hard to mock the GJS functions).

Features:
  ☐ enable using the image widget with sliders

  ☐ support markup on labels

  ☐ expose main.notify('', '')
  ☐ expose https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/st10~1.0_api/st.clipboard

  ☐ create a debug plugin to help developers create plugins
    - plug should log all plugin errors to GNOME and the debug plugin
    should just grep them every second
