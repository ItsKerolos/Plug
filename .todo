Performance Issues and Bugs:
  
Testing:
  ☐ setup a Jest environment for unit testing
    - we need to test
      (enable & disable & load & unload & killing)
      those things can break the shell if an issue during them,
      (it won't be that hard to mock the GJS functions).
    - tests for parse ops like detecting a separator line.

Features:
  ☐ expose Gio.AppInfo.launch_default_for_uri

  ☐ create a preferences window
    - list all running plugins and their config values
    - delete or disable (kill) plugins
    - add a log window that plug and its plugins can log stuff to for better debugging.

Documentation:
  ☐ about markup

  ☐ rewrite the entire thing to be focused on widgets with code examples and screenshots instead of formatting.
    - when we add more widgets.
