Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ test enabling and disabling the extension on a real working plugin
    and look for any errors that might occur

Testing:
  ☐ setup a Jest environment for unit testing
    - we need to test enable & disable & load & unload
      those thing can break the shell if an issue occurs,
      it will not be hard to mockup GJS functions.

Features:
  ☐ enable using image files with button
  ☐ enable using the image widget with labels & sliders

  ☐ support markup on labels

  ☐ create a debug plugin to help developers create plugins
    - plug should log all plugin errors to GNOME and the debug plugin
    should just grep them every second

Documentation:
  ☐ document the fact about the 5 seconds timeout for plugins
  ☐ document about reloading
  ☐ document intervals, positions, priorities
  ☐ document execute, main
  ☐ document widgets
